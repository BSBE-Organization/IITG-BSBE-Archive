I am attaching the pdf of grades of all the courses of year 2023 above so that you can know and decide how professor in each course grades.
Points to remember are- the courses starting with BT6XX also has PhD students who can increase the class average marks affecting the relative grading. Also the professors of all the courses are more or less the same. Instructors of only a few courses change every year.
